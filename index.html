    <p>It all started on a faithful day, <i>August 30th 2024</i> at the <i>VERY very normal hours of 3am</i> where my boyfriend asked "Hey do you want to play TFT?". Foolishly I replied with <i>yes</i>, and that is where my TFT Adventures, and Addictions begins.  On August 31st, was the first time I personally loaded the game up, and upon looking at the TFT store, I was blindsided and spent $11 on an Arena skin cuz it was like really pretty and stuff(Pst I got told off for spending money on the game shortly after). After equiping the arena skin, I went on to play 8 tft games over the course of the next 6 hours(I lost track of time). It is now September 13 2024, so around 2 weeks has passed, and I have consistently played atleast 2 tft games a day, as a one trick pony to what I would say is the best TFT Team Comp in this set <i>Scholar Stars</i>. But TFT has such ass rng, and definetly not a skill issue on my part, where they wont give me the champions I need like where is my 3 star Ahri, or Lillia, and why cant I get no Tears or Cloaks, why does this game keep giving me bows, what am I gonna use a bow for on AP Champions(I am definitely not tilted). Well thats has been my journey on TFT so far. Below are the Scholar Stars Team Comp and their items </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ahri</li>
      <li>Lillia</li>
      <li>Poppy</li>
      <li>Ryze</li>
      <li>Zoe</li>
      <li>Taric</li>
      <li>Hecarim</li>
      <li>Xerath</li>
    </ul>
